# Devito: Symbolic Finite Difference Computation

[Devito](http://www.devitoproject.org) is a Python package to implement
optimized stencil computation (e.g., finite differences, image processing,
machine learning) from high-level symbolic problem definitions.  Devito builds
on [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) and employs automated code
generation and just-in-time compilation to execute optimized computational
kernels on several computer platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and clusters
thereof.
