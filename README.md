# Devito: Symbolic Finite Difference Computation

Devito is a Python package to implement optimized stencil computation (e.g., finite differences, image processing, machine learning) from high-level symbolic problem definitions. Devito builds on SymPy and employs automated code generation and just-in-time compilation to execute optimized computational kernels on several computer platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and clusters thereof.

Symbolic computation is a powerful tool that allows users to:

- Build complex solvers from only a few lines of high-level code
- Use automated performance optimisation for generated code
- Adjust stencil discretisation at runtime as required
(Re-)development of solver code in hours/days rather than months
